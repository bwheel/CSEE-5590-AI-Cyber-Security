In general you'll use `ImageFolder` like so:\n","\n","```python\n","dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/data', transform=transform)\n","```\n","\n","where `'path/to/data'` is the file path to the data directory and `transform` is a list of processing steps built with the [`transforms`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) module from `torchvision`. ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed like so:\n","```\n","root/dog/xxx.png\n","root/dog/xxy.png\n","root/dog/xxz.png\n","\n","root/cat/123.png\n","root/cat/nsdf3.png\n","root/cat/asd932_.png\n","```\n","\n","where each class has it's own directory (`cat` and `dog`) for the images. The images are then labeled with the class taken from the directory name. So here, the image `123.png` would be loaded with the class label `cat`. You can download the dataset already structured like this [from here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip). I've also split it into a training set and test set.\n","\n","### Transforms\n","\n","When you load in the data with `ImageFolder`, you'll need to define some transforms. For example, the images are different sizes but we'll need them to all be the same size for training. You can either resize them with `transforms.Resize()` or crop with `transforms.CenterCrop()`, `transforms.RandomResizedCrop()`, etc. We'll also need to convert the images to PyTorch tensors with `transforms.ToTensor()`. Typically you'll combine these transforms into a pipeline with `transforms.Compose()`, which accepts a list of transforms and runs them in sequence. It looks something like this to scale, then crop, then convert to a tensor:\n","\n","```python\n","transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255),\n","                                 transforms.CenterCrop(224),\n","                                 transforms.ToTensor()])\n","\n","```\n","\n","There are plenty of transforms available, I'll cover more in a bit and you can read through the [documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html). \n","\n","### Data Loaders\n","\n","With the `ImageFolder` loaded, you have to pass it to a [`DataLoader`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader). The `DataLoader` takes a dataset (such as you would get from `ImageFolder`) and returns batches of images and the corresponding labels. You can set various parameters like the batch size and if the data is shuffled after each epoch.\n","\n","```python\n","dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\n","```\n","\n","Here `dataloader` is a [generator](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/). To get data out of it, you need to loop through it or convert it to an iterator and call `next()`.\n","\n","```python\n","# Looping through it, get a batch on each loop \n","for images, labels in dataloader:\n","    pass\n","\n","# Get one batch\n","images, labels = next(iter(dataloader))\n","```\n"," \n",">**Exercise:** Load images from the `Cat_Dog_data/train` folder, define a few transforms, then build the

randomness in the input data itself. For example, you can randomly rotate, mirror, scale, and/or crop your images during training. This will help your network generalize as it's seeing the same images but in different locations, with different sizes, in different orientations, etc.\n","\n","To randomly rotate, scale and crop, then flip your images you would define your transforms like this:\n","\n","```python\n","train_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomRotation(30),\n","                                       transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),\n","                                       transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n","                                       transforms.ToTensor(),\n","                                       transforms.Normalize([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], \n","                                                            [0.5, 0.5, 0.5])])\n","```\n","\n","You'll also typically want to normalize images with `transforms.Normalize`. You pass in a list of means and list of standard deviations, then the color channels are normalized like so\n","\n","```input[channel] = (input[channel] - mean[channel]) / std[channel]```\n","\n","Subtracting `mean` centers the data around zero and dividing by `std` squishes the values to be between -1 and 1. Normalizing helps keep the network work weights near zero which in turn makes backpropagation more stable. Without normalization, networks will tend to fail to learn.\n","\n","You can find a list of all [the available transforms here](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/torchvision/transforms.html). When you're testing however, you'll want to use images that aren't altered (except you'll need to normalize the same way).
